    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 80;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = "james"
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = "jimmy";
    // console.log(name, name2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(players, team);


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    team = players.slice();
    team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(players, team);



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team2 = [].concat(players);
    team2[3] = "T2"

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team3 = [...players];
    team3[3] = "T3"


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    let team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = "T4";
    console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // let cap = person;
    // cap.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, cap)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100, age: 2 });
    console.log(person, cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
